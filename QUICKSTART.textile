h1. Quick Start Guide

These instructions were made on Windows but they should be similar on other platforms.

h4. Start by installing Ruby (see .ruby-version)

Use rvm, asdf, whatever you prefer.

Windows: Make sure you allow the binaries to be added to your PATH

h4. Open a new command prompt to your vault2git folder and run:

gem install bundler
bundle install

h4. Locate your installation of SourceGear Vault Client.

You can edit the options.rb file to set this value if it differs from the default. It's not necessary but saves you from having to include on the command line every time.

h4. Create the folder structure for where you want your new git repository to be created.

Invoke the vault2git script like so:

<code>
ruby vault2git.rb --host VAULT_SERVER --repo VAULT_REPOSITORY_NANE -u VAULT_USER -p VAULT_PASSWORD VAULT_SOURCE GIT_DESTINATION
</code>
<code>
ruby vault2git.rb --host localhost --repo "Initial Repository" -u user -p password $/Apps/Alpha C:/source/git/Alpha
</code>

Make sure to put quotes around any parameters containing a space.

You might need some additional clean up steps to remove the Vault bindings from your projects. For example, Visual Studio embeds Vault source control information in solutions and project files.
