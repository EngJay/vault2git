## About

The vault2git project provides a simple command line tool for migrating a
[SourceGear Vault](http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/) project to a
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository.

This fork of the original Ruby port by @slamotte updates the dependencies to
current, adds quality control, converts the script to a RubyGem, and will
add additional features in subsequent releases.

Ultimately, the aim is to provide a simple to use, high-quality command line
tool for migrating a project from SourceGear Vault to Git in high-scrutiny 
contexts. The key new feature planned is automatic validation of a migration
by generating and comparing hashes of each Vault check-in against the 
correpsonding Git commit.

### Process

Given a Vault project path, it creates a new Git repository, fetches the list of Vault check-ins, then iterates through each of the check-ins performing the following steps:

- clear out the Git repository folder (except `.git*` files)
- fetch the current check-in's files from Vault
- add and commit the files to Git, including a commit message that is either the message associated with the Vault check-in or its metadata. 

The comments written to Git include the original Vault comments (if any) plus a one-liner containing the original Vault version number, check-in time, etc. The original Vault check-in time is used as the commit's time.

### Built With
